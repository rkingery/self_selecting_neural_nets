# Self-selecting Neural Networks

In this repository are various implementations of self-selecting neural networks. Feel free to play around and improve on anything here. Bugs have been (mostly) tested for, but I wouldn't use anything here for industrial applications yet. Updates are sporatic, and the usual optimizations haven't been performed yet. Thanks for visiting!
